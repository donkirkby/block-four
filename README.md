# Block Four
A tetromino board game for two players with blind bidding

## Equipment
* A board with nine fields, each of which has nine spaces
* Five cards for each player, with the five tetromino shapes and numbers one to
    five.
* A pencil for writing X's and O's on the board

## Goal
Control five fields to win the game. Control a field by filling in five spaces.

## Setup
One player shuffles the five X cards and lets the other player pick two cards.
Without looking at them, the player that picked the cards hands one of them
back. Then both players reveal their cards. The player with the higher number
takes the X cards and leaves the two revealed cards face up on the table in
front of them. The other player takes the five O cards in their hand.

## Play
At the start of each turn, each player secretly chooses two cards from their
hand, then both players reveal their chosen cards. Check to see how many cards
match the other player's choices.

### No Matches
If the players chose four different shapes, then each player gets to fill in
spaces with their X or O symbol to make the chosen tetromino shape. Players
fill in the shapes in order: I, L, O, T, Z. Players may fill in the shape on the
card or its mirror-image shape.

### One Match
If players chose one matching shape, then they may fill in two copies of the
other shape they chose.

### Two Matches
If players chose both shapes the same, they don't fill in anything.

In order to fill in a shape, there must be four empty spaces in the right
positions to make the shape. If there is nowhere available on the board to make
the chosen shape, skip that shape.

If a player fills in a shape that leaves a gap of three or fewer spaces, the
other player fills in the gap.

At the end of each turn, the player with one card left in their hand picks up
their four cards from the table. The other player should have three cards in
their hand, and doesn't pick up any.

## Winning
When a player has filled in five or more spaces in a field, they control that
field. When a player controls five or more fields, they win. Players may still
fill in empty spaces in a controlled field.
